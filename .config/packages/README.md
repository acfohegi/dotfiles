Use `./query_pacman.sh` and `./query_yay.sh` to see the differences between your currently installed packages and the package lists `packages_pacman.txt` and `packages_yay.txt`:

- packages that are installed on the system but not present in the list
- packages that are listed in the file but not installed

The scripts `install_pacman.sh` and `install_yay.sh` install (or reinstall) all packages in the lists.

There is also a separate script `install_themes.sh` that handles the installation of themes and related components.
